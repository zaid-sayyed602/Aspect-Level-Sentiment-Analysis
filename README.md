# Aspect-Level-Sentiment-Analysis

OBJECTIVE:-Created a model to find multiple aspect and its particular description with its polarity in a review and also handling
all the types of negations,positive and negative words.........

TECHNIQUES:- Collecting of Data through Scraping , Cleaning The Data ,Removing Noise from Data ,Lemmatizing The Data ,Pos-Tagging The Data , Finding The Polarity Of The Review Using Textblob ,Labelling The Polarity With Negative Positive or Neutral respectively ,Label encoding the Labels , Storing All The Positive Negative and Neutral in particular variables ,TFIDF Vectorizing the Variables ,Creating a Word Cloud Of Positive Negative and Neutral Words ,TFIDF Vectorizing all the reviews with max features of 5000 , Training multiple models such as Logistic Regression and SVM and Decision Tree , Checking the Accuracy of all the models ,Further Using SVM model ,Saving the model with pickle, Getting prediction of a review wheather positive negative or neutral ,Creating a spaCy algorithm for picking particular ASPECT and its Description ,Storing all the important description on which the review is positive or negative with all the negations in the review , Getting the prediction of the description which was collected by the algorithm ,Storing the Aspect and The description with its predicted polarity in a list ,Creating a Tkinter GUI for better user interface ,Displaying All the Aspect in a review with its description
